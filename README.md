## 🔐 Security

- **AES encryption** is applied to images before uploading.
- Data is securely stored and transmitted via Supabase and HTTPS.
- Only verified officials can view and respond to emergency reports.

## 🧑‍⚕️ Emergency Flow

1. User captures an image (fire/medical/crime).
2. AI model (YOLOv8) verifies the emergency.
3. Data is AES encrypted and sent to Supabase.
4. Officials are notified and can view, accept or reject requests.
